Breaking Bread- Breaking Bread is a recipe sharing site designed to futher the idea of community beyond the user's kitchen table to the web. Registering a new profile on the app is not required to view the recipes. However, users that choose to join by creating a login are able to view and share.

Specs:
-Custom API 
-Cloudinary for uploading images
-Created login creditals for user

Future Development:
- On the user side, adding photos/avatars to user profiles

- Make the inputs for the recipes more detailed (tablespoon, teaspoon, cup, pint, etc)
